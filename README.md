# -E-Learning-System
In this new era of electronics, we know the concept of e-learning which does not include the use of paper and pen. There are many advantages of e-learning system. In this e-learning system we can assign projects to students and can share documents and more easily. This system has three modules including student, faculties and Admin. Students can login, they have access to main menu, calendar, projects, documentation, to upload, view the things uploaded by the faculties, knowledge books, also send messages to faculties. Faculties can login and have access for viewing, uploading documents and projects. Admin can login and manage the faculties and student details and also view projects. This is how the new concept of e-learning came into existence, which is an easier and smarter system for colleges.

# DESIGN<br>
Database Design is a collection of processes that facilitate the designing, development, implementation and maintenance of enterprise data management systems.<br>
It helps produce database systems:<br>
*   That meet the requirements of the users<br>
*   Have high performance.<br>

**Architecture Description** <br>
The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or decentralized or hierarchical. The architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier.<br><br>
